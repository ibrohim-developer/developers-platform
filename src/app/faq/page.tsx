    question: "What is the difference between IELTS Academic and General Training?",
    answer:
      "IELTS Academic is for higher education and professional registration. General Training is for migration and secondary education. Both share Listening and Speaking sections but differ in Reading and Writing content.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is IELTS scored?",
    answer:
      "IELTS uses a 9-band system. You receive individual scores for Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking, plus an Overall Band Score that averages these four, rounded to the nearest whole or half band.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I retake just one section of IELTS?",
    answer:
      "Yes. IELTS One Skill Retake lets you retake a single section within 60 days of your original test date at participating centers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does BandUp's AI scoring work?",
    answer:
      "BandUp uses advanced AI models trained on examiner-graded scripts to evaluate your writing and provide instant band score predictions with detailed feedback on grammar, vocabulary, coherence, and task achievement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is BandUp free to use?",
    answer:
      "Yes! BandUp offers free IELTS mock exams for Reading, Listening, and Writing modules. You can practice with real exam-style questions and get instant AI-powered feedback at no cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long is the IELTS test?",
    answer:
      "The total IELTS test takes about 2 hours and 45 minutes: Listening (30 minutes), Reading (60 minutes), Writing (60 minutes), and Speaking (11-14 minutes, may be on a separate day).",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I take IELTS in Uzbekistan?",
    answer:
      "IELTS is available at British Council and IDP testing centers across Uzbekistan, including Tashkent, Samarkand, and other major cities. You can register through exams.uz (IDP) or britishcouncil.uz.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are BandUp's mock test scores?",
    answer:
      "Our AI scoring models are calibrated against thousands of examiner-graded scripts. While no prediction is perfect, our scores typically fall within +/- 0.5 bands of actual IELTS scores.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I practice with mock tests?",
    answer:
      "For optimal preparation, we recommend taking at least 2-3 full mock tests per week, with daily practice on individual modules. Consistent practice over 4-8 weeks typically yields significant score improvements.",
